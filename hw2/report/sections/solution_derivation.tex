\section*{Derivation of the solution}

\subsection*{Jacobian}

Since the manipulator consists only of revolute joints, I used formula for revolute joints from geometrical approach:

$$J(q) = \begin{pmatrix}
    J_{p_i} \\ J_{\omega_i}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    z_{i - 1} \times (p_e - p_{i - 1}) \\
    z_{i - 1}
\end{pmatrix}$$

\subsection*{Singularity check}

To check for singularity I calculated rank of the matrix and checked if it is equal to 6

\subsection*{Cartesian velocity}

Vector of velocities in cartesian space (or twist) can be found as 
$$\begin{pmatrix}
    v \\ \omega
\end{pmatrix} = J \dot q $$
