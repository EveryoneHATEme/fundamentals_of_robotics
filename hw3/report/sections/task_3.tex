\section*{Task 3}

\subsection*{Task statement}

Consider you have controller frequency of 20 Hz

\subsection*{Solution}

Let $\phi = 20\ Hz$ is the frequency.

Now we should redefine $t_b = \frac{\ceil*{t_b \phi}}{\phi}$ and $t_b = \frac{\ceil*{t_{na} \phi}}{\phi}$, now they are satisfy the frequency of the controller.
Then we can find the trajectory taking to account the frequency as described before.
